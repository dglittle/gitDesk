Each buyer would have his own repository(ies).
- The buyer links his github account
- The buyer selects a repository to use for this particular issue

Add optional skills line? (no skills in job post –> append in description)

Auth:
- use oauth for both oDesk and Git (all API, no UI hacking)


-----------------------
CLIENT
-----------------------

Auth GitDesk
- If fully auth'd, go to "My Issues"
- If oDesk session, "link GitHub account"

Add Issue
- Select repo, title and description

View Issue (also shown on "add issue" confirmation)
- Show the issue
 	+ GitHub issue link and status
	+ title and description
	+ price and a blurb about what that means
- Link to job as developers will see it
- Status
	+ open pull requests (link to each)
	+ cancel buttons (several options)
- Back to My Issues

View Pull Request
- (look at the GitHub pull request UI)

-----------------------
AUTH
-----------------------
1) Go to gitDesk.herokuapp.com: you see a splash page, with a prompt to log in to / auth oDesk
2) Once you do that, you are prompted to link your GitHub – click to do the GH oauth process
3) You're redirected to gitDesk
-----------------------
CONTRACTOR FINDS JOB
-----------------------
The issue link in the oDesk job doesn't go to GitHub, it goes to gitDesk interstitial
- If the contractor is already registered on gitDesk, redirect silently to GitHub issue
- Else, prompt to link their GH account to oDesk ("so you can get paid automatically for this issue")
- Then redirect to GH issue
-----------------------
AUTO-PAYMENT
-----------------------
Upon issue close, we figure out whom to pay:
- If only one pull request, pay him
- If >1 pull request, pay the last pull requester
- (Possibly complexity: notify the client and ask them if they want to pay others)
-----------------------
MERGING AND CLOSING
-----------------------
We'll assume that if you accept (i.e. merge) someone's pull request, you pay them (queue up in 2 days).
No "close and pay" on gitDesk.
Two exception cases:
1) You merged but don't want to pay: show pending payment in gitDesk, with "cancel" button
2) You didn't merge, but you do want to pay: show non-merged pull-requests, with "pay" button
