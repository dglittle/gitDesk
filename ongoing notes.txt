GREG'S PRIORITY LIST:
#1 - Create Pair (with optional GitHub issue parameter) and Get Pairs (see required dataset in web.js under )
#2 - Enable simultaneous authentication

* "Claim Job" screen
* 



/api/createpair creates an issue on github. it doesn't create a job yet. To do so, it needs to know what team to put it in.. which means we need an interface for choosing a team.

I added an api for getting the available teams: /api/getteams, and an api for setting a team: /api/setteam?team={companyRef:123,teamRef:456,teamName:"blah"}

(you can just pass the json blob for the team that you get from /api/getteams, and you can access the team from swig as "team")
